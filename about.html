            <p>The current warming trend is of particular significance because most of it is extremely likely (greater
                than
                95% probability) to be the result of human activity since the mid-20th century and proceeding at a rate
                that
                is unprecedented over decades to millennia <br>https://climate.nasa.gov/evidence/

            <p>Earth-orbiting satellites and other technological advances have enabled scientists to see the big
                picture,
                collecting many different types of information about our planet and its climate on a global scale. This
                body
                of data, collected over many years, reveals the signals of a changing climate
                <br>https://climate.nasa.gov/evidence/
            </p>
            <p>Ice cores drawn from Greenland, Antarctica, and tropical mountain glaciers show that Earthâ€™s climate
                responds
                to changes in greenhouse gas levels. Ancient evidence can also be found in tree rings, ocean sediments,
                coral reefs, and layers of sedimentary rocks. This ancient, or paleoclimate, evidence reveals that
                current
                warming is occurring roughly ten times faster than the average rate of ice-age-recovery warming. Carbon
                dioxide from human activity is increasing more than 250 times faster than it did from natural sources
                after
                the last Ice Age. <br>https://climate.nasa.gov/evidence/
